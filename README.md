This project showcases the development of a Dual-Sensor Precision Climate Controller tailored for industrial use, completed during my bachelor's studies. It was featured at the NEN E-Week '16 Technical Exhibition at the Institute of Engineering & Management. The system employs GY-BME280-5V and DHT22 sensors to monitor temperature and humidity, ensuring high accuracy and reliability. An IIC/I2C Serial Interface Adapter Module displays real-time data on an LCD screen, all managed by an Arduino microcontroller. This climate controller is designed for use in manufacturing, storage, and server rooms, providing optimal environmental conditions. The integration of dual sensors enhances the system's dependability, making it a robust solution for critical industrial environments.
